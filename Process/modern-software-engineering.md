# Modern Software Engineering

* [“Modern Software Engineering: Doing What Works to Build Better Software Faster” by Dave Farley](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Software-Engineering-Discipline-Development/dp/0137314914) is the best single source on how to develop quality software in a timely manner that I know of. It synthesizes much of the learning the industry has gained through the agile movement (strongly leaning on Extreme Programming), the code craftsmanship , and the DevOps/Continuous Integration movement. There is a [good audiobook of this work](https://www.audible.com/pd/Modern-Software-Engineering-Audiobook/B0BLY5PL64).
  * [Notes on the book](https://www.davefarley.net/?p=352) from the author’s website
  * [A review of the book](https://www.patkua.com/blog/book-review-modern-software-engineering/) from one of the authors of [“Building Evolutionary Architectures”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1492097543)
  * A lot of what Dave talks about in ths book is justified by the [DORA Reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_Research_and_Assessment), which show a correlation between technical practices and high team performance (and better business outcomes).
    * The process creating the DORA Reports is further explained in [“Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations” by Nichole Fosgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim](https://www.amazon.com/Accelerate-Software-Performing-Technology-Organizations/dp/1942788339). There is also an [audiobook of this work](https://www.audible.com/pd/Accelerate-Building-and-Scaling-High-Performing-Technology-Organizations-Audiobook/B07BLZDZFQ).
  * My only criticism of “Modern Software Engineering” is that it has not caught up with Mob/Ensemble programming, and has too little about integrating functional programming.
