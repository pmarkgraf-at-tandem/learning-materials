# Ensemble Programming / Mob Programming / Software Teaming

What is Software Teaming?

* “All the brilliant minds working together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer.”
  * We call it Software Teaming, also known as Mob Programming or Ensemble Programming.
* We strive to accentuate and amplify concepts such as face-to-face and side-by-side communication, team alignment, collaboration, whole team involvement, continuous code review, and the “self-organizing team.”

## Ancestry

* Software Teaming builds on concepts introduced by Extreme Programming and Continuous Delivery.
  * [_Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change_](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Programming-Explained-Embrace-Change/dp/0321278658) by Kent Beck
    * Software Teaming is an evolutionary step beyond the Extreme Programming concept of Pair Programming.
  * [_Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation_](https://www.amazon.com/Continuous-Delivery-Deployment-Automation-Addison-Wesley-ebook/dp/B003YMNVC0) by Jez Humble & David Farley
    * Continuous Delivery also built on concepts from Extreme Programming, especially!
* Software Teaming was refined by concepts from [_Teaming: How Organizations Learn, Innovate, and Compete in the Knowledge Economy_](https://www.amazon.com/Teaming-Organizations-Innovate-Compete-Knowledge/dp/078797093X) by Amy C. Edmondson
  * Also check out her book [_The Fearless Organization: Creating Psychological Safety in the Workplace for Learning, Innovation, and Growth_](https://www.amazon.com/Fearless-Organization-Psychological-Workplace-Innovation-ebook/dp/B07KLT8RKM), which is amazing!
