# TDD (Test Driven Development)

## Books

* [“Test Driven Development: By Example” by Kent Beck](https://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Kent-Beck/dp/0321146530) is a great general resource on TDD practices. There is a lot of depth and insight in this book and it is worth a careful read.
* ["Working Effectively with Legacy Code" by Michael Feathers](https://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052) describes techniques for adding test coverage and adding new functionality to code with insufficient test coverage or test quality.
  * This book defines "legacy code" as any code with insufficient test automation. While not the most common definition, it is useful in the context of this book.
