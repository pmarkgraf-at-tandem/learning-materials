# Refactoring

I've been promoting a strategy of doing code clean-up before making feature/bugfix related changes as a strategy to take schedule pressure out of the "keeping code clean" process. This is not an original idea of mine:

* ["Tidy First? : A Personal Exercise in Empirical Software Design" by Kent Beck](https://www.amazon.com/Tidy-First-Personal-Exercise-Empirical/dp/1098151240) is a book specifically on this idea. It is a pretty quick read and also available as an audiobook (how I read it.)
  * Here is a [review of the book](https://henrikwarne.com/2024/01/10/tidy-first/).
  * Here is a [conference talk by the author](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Saaz6D1azlU) on the topic.
  * Kent also talks about the origin of the book in this [chat with Dave Farley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guycIP56YeY).
